To create the program that retrieves student data from a text file, sorts it, and allows searching by name, follow these step-by-step instructions:

Step 1: Set Up the Project

Create a new Visual Studio Windows Console Project.
Name the project as project-2.

Step 2: Create the Text File

Create a text file using Notepad or any text editor.

Name the file "student_data.txt" (or any other suitable name).
Add student data to the file in the format "Name, Class" for each student, one per line.
Save the file.

Step 3: Read and Load Data from the Text File

In your C# project, create a class to represent a Student. The class should have properties for "Name" and "Class."
Read the data from the "student_data.txt" file, parse it, and store it as a list of Student objects in memory.

Step 4: Sorting the Data

Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, or using LINQ) to sort the list of students by their names in ascending order.

Step 5: Search by Name

Implement a method to search for a student by name. The user should input a name, and the program should display the student's details if found.

Step 6: Display the Sorted Data

Display the sorted list of students' data on the screen.

Step 7: GitHub Repository and Version Control

Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
Initialize the repository and commit the initial project setup.
Regularly commit your code as you make progress to keep track of changes.

Step 8: Documentation

Maintain a README.md file in your repository that explains the project, its purpose, and how to use the program.
Document the steps you took to complete the project, including any challenges faced and how you overcame them.
Add comments in your code to explain the logic and functionality of various sections.

Step 9: Final Testing

Test your program thoroughly to ensure that it retrieves, sorts, and searches student data correctly.
Handle edge cases, such as when the file is empty or when a search query doesn't match any student's name.

Step 10: Push to GitHub

Once your project is complete and fully tested, push the final version of your code to the GitHub repository.
Make sure to update the README.md file with any necessary information about the project
